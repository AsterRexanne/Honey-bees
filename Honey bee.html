        Honey bees
    </h1>
    <h1>
        Here's some buzz about honey bees
    </h1>
    <!--Content-1-->
    <h2>Describtion</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        They are somewhat variable in colour but are 
        <mark style="background-color:powderblue">
            usually brown with a banded dull yellow and brown abdomen.
        </mark>
         The head, thorax and abdomen are densely covered in hair. The legs and around the eyes are also hairy.
         Honey bees are 
        <mark style="background-color:powderblue">
            known for their construction of perennial colonial nests from wax, the large size of their colonies, 
            and surplus production and storage of honey,
        </mark>
          distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals, including honey badgers, 
          bears and human hunter-gatherers.Depending on its nectar source, honey can be 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            floral, fruity, smoky, woody, spicy, nutty or earthy.
        </mark> 
        It can smell fresh as grass or pungent like aged cheese. It can look nearly clear as water or 
        dark as molasses.
    </p>

    <h2>Characteristics...</h2>
    <h3>...of a Queen bee</h3>
    <p>
        The queen is the largest bee in the colony. Her wings only make it half way down her abdomen, whereas 
        the other bees have wings fully covering the abdomen. A queen honey bee is around 20 mm in size.
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            Her most important anatomical characteristics are her female reproductive organs, such as the 
            spermatheca.
        </mark>
    </p>
    <h3>...of a Worker Honey Bee</h3>
    <p>
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            Worker bees are shorter and more slender than drones and the queen, and their back legs have 
            special baskets to help them collect pollen.
        </mark>
        Like the queen, they also have stingers, but they can only sting mammals once and then they die. 
        They can, however, sting other insects over and over again to protect the hive.      
    </p>
    <h3>...of a female honey bee</h3>
    <p>
        The body is covered with small hairs, including on the eyes. There are three distinct forms of the 
        honey bee: 
    <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
        the queen (fertile female) is about three-fourths inch long;
    </mark>
        the worker (sterile female) is about one-half inch in length; and the drone (male) is about ﬁve-eighths 
        inch long.
    </p>
    <h3>...of a male honey bee</h3>
    <p>
        A drone is a male bee. Unlike the female worker bee, 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            a drone has no stinger.
        </mark>
         He does not gather nectar or pollen and cannot feed without assistance from worker bees. His only role 
        is to mate with a maiden queen in nuptial flight.
    </p>
    <!--Content-3-->
    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <p>Honey bees are social creatures and live in colonies. However, they do display some aggressive behavior 
        within colonies: 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            drones are ejected from their nests during cold weather, and a queen will sometimes sting other 
            queens during mating fights for dominance.
        </mark>
    </p>
    <!--Content-4-->
    <h2>Species</h2>
    <p>
        Out of the 20,000 different species of bees, 250 are bumblebees, 500-600 are stingless bees, and 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            7 are honeybees.
        </mark>
        These seven are:</br>
        1.Western honey bee</br>
        2.Apis cerana</br>
        3.Apis dorsata</br>
        4.Apis florea</br>
        5.Apis andreniformis</br>
        6.Apis nigrocincta</br>
        7.Apis koschevnikovi</br>
    </p>
    <h3>Describtion of...</h3>
    <h4>...Western honey bee</h4>
    <p>
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            The workers and queens have venomous stingers, whereas the drones are stingless.
        </mark>
        Like all insects, western honeybees have a chitinous exoskeleton, and their bodies are divided into 
        three segments: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The head and thorax are somewhat bristly and vary in 
        color according to the strain.
    </p>
    <h4>...Apis cerana</h4>
    <p>
        Apis cerana is known to be 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue">
            a very docile, gentle, and even somewhat timid
        </mark>
        , but there can be large differences in their defensiveness depending on season and region. 
        Apis cerana colonies tend to swarm and abscond (abandon a hive location) more frequently than do Apis 
        mellifera colonies.
    </p>
    <h4>...Apis dorsata</h4>
    <p>
        Apis dorsata 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue;">
            looks very similar to Apis mellifera, but is larger in size.
        </mark>
        Apis dorsata workers can measure up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in length, which is almost twice the length of an 
        Apis mellifera worker; thus they are known as the "giant" honey bees.
    </p>
    <h4>...Apis florea</h4>
    <p>
        Apis florea is called 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue;">
           dwarf honey bee
        </mark>
         due to its small size compared to other honeybees. A worker is typically 7–10 mm in body length and 
         its overall coloration is red-brown. A colony builds a single, exposed comb usually on tree branches 
         or shrubs.
    </p>
    <h4>...Apis andreniformis</h4>
    <p>
        Apis andreniformis, commonly known as the black dwarf honey bee, is 
        <mark style="background-color:powderblue">
            the smallest of all species of honey bees (between 6.5 mm and 9.5-10 mm)
        </mark>
        , and along with Apis florea constitute the subgenus Micrapis (or dwarf honey bees).
    </p>
    <h4>Apis nigrocincta</h4>
    <p>
        Apis nigrocincta is a 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue;">
            medium sized honey bee that is slightly larger in size than Apis cerana
        </mark>
        although a range of body length has not been documented for this bee. Apis nigrocincta also has a 
        yellow clypeus (part of the insect face above the mouth) and yellow hind femora (Keeling et al).
    </p>
    <h4>...Apis koschevnikovi</h4>
    <p>
        Apis koschevnikovi, Koschevnikov's honey bee, is 
        <mark style="background-color: powderblue;">
            a species of honey bee which inhabits Malaysian and Indonesian Borneo
        </mark>
        , where it lives sympatrically with other honey bee species such as Apis cerana (specifically A. c. 
        nuluensis).
